<b>Wellerman</b></p>
<p>There once was a
ship that put to sea<br/>
The name of the ship was the Billy O'
Tea<br/>
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down<br/>
Oh blow, my
bully boys, blow (huh)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm; ">
<b><u>Chorus</u><br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br/>
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum<br/>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br/>
We'll take our leave
and go</b></p>

<p>She had not been two weeks from shore<br/>
When down on her a right whale bore<br/>
The
captain called all hands and swore<br/>
He'd take that whale in tow
(huh)</p>

<p>Before the boat had
hit the water<br/>
The whale's tail came up and caught her<br/>
All
hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br/>
When she dived down
low (huh)</p>

<p>No line was cut, no
whale was freed<br/>
The captain's mind was not of greed<br/>
And he
belonged to the Whaleman's creed<br/>
She took that ship in tow (huh)</p>

<p>For forty days or
even more <br/>
The line went slack then tight once more<br/>
All
boats were lost, there were only four<br/>
But still that whale did
go (huh)</p>

<p>As far as I've
heard, the fight's still on<br/>
The line's not cut, and the whale's
not gone<br/>
The Wellerman makes his regular call<br/>
To encourage
the captain, crew and all (huh)</p>
