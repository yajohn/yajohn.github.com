<h1>Wellerman</h1>

<p>There was a ship that put to sea<br>
And the name of the ship was „The Billy o‘ Tea“<br>
The wind blew up, her bows dipped down<br>
Oh blow, me bully boys, blow</p>

<p><b><u>Chorus</u><br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
Brings us sugar and tea and rum<br>
Some day, when the tonguing’s done<br>
We’ll take our leave and go</b></p>

<p>She had not been two weeks from shore<br>
When down on her a right whale bore<br>
The Captain called all hands and swore<br>
He’d take that whale in tow</p>

<p>Before the boat had hit the water<br>
The whale’s tail came up and caught her<br>
All hands to the side harpooned and fought her<br>
When she dived down below</p>

<p>No line was cut, no whale was freed<br>
The Captain’s mind was not of greed<br>
But he belonged to the whaleman’s creed<br>
She took the ship in tow</p>

<p>For forty days, or even more<br>
The line went slack, than tight once more<br>
All boats were lost, there were only four<br>
But still the whale did go</p>

<p>As far as I’ve heard, the fight’s still on<br>
The line’s not cut, the whale’s not gone<br>
The Wellerman makes his regular call<br>
To encourage the Captain, crew and all</p>
