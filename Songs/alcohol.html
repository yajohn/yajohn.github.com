	Yeah, oh yeah, you seen me walk on burning bridges<br/>
Yeah, oh
	yeah, you seen me fall in love with witches<br/>
And you know my
	head is held inside by stitches<br/>
Yet you know I did survive all
	of your lonely sieges</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10; ">
<b>And you know that I'll pick up every time you call<br/>
Just
	to thank you one more time<br/>
Alcohol, oh alcohol, alcohol<br/><br/>
And you know that I'll survive very time you call<br/>
Just
	to thank you one more time for everything you've done<br/>
Alcohol,
	alcohol</b></p>
<p>I am sorry some of us given you bad name<br/>
Yeah, oh yeah, 'cause we
	love you, nothing is the same<br/>
Yeah, oh yeah, I miss you so
	every time we breakup<br/>
Just to hit a higher note every time we
	makeup</p>
	
<p>Who
	is crawling up my spine?<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
I was waiting long,
	long time<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
Now you teach me how to
	rhyme<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
Just don't stab in the back with a
	cortisol<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
Now forever reunite<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
Now
	you teach me how to rhyme<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
Screw a light bulb in
	my head<br/>
(Alcohol)<br/>
May the ceremony be happy or sad</p>
